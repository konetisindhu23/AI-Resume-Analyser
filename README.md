# AI Resume Analyzer

This project is an AI-powered tool designed to evaluate resumes for specific job roles and provide actionable feedback.  
It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to parse resumes, extract key information, match them against job descriptions, and generate compatibility scores.  
The tool helps candidates improve their resumes and assists recruiters or institutions in screening them more efficiently.
